-I added [Authorize] above the Index Get method in PlantsController.cs

-Created a registered user that has changes reflected in database
	-Changes are reflected into MySql
	-Petsafe123@gmail.com
	-Petsafe123

-I deleted the old database in MySql. Migrate and update from visual studios, Imported the plantcsv file into the new database. Then did Operational test
to make sure I was able to edit, add, create, and delete information from the database. The changes and test were reflected into MySql after refreshing.

-I created a search controller with the intent of making it require authorization before access aswell.
	-It should require sign in before allowing access.
	-Should be on a seperate page to allow room for users to see full results.

	-Tested the website so far and next feature Im working on is the search Feature which will be also needing authorization

	-Created a new user to reflect changes, 
		-Petsafesecond@gmail.com
		-Petsafe123

	-Added Bootstrap style, the file is named vapor and can be found in wwwroot/css/vapor.css
		-Made changes too /shared/_layout.cshtml to account for the bootstrap changes.

	-Search bar does not function however I was wondering if it was possible to make work and display only on View, Add, Edit, and delete

	-Will add more personal customations to make the website more appealing.
